__LITTLE_ENDIAN__ to match the endianness of the architecture being
compiled for. This is not necessarily the same as the architecture of the
machine doing the building. In order to support Universal Binaries on
Mac OS X, we prefer those defines to decide the endianness.
On other platforms we use the result of the TRY_RUN. */
